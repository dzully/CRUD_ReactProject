# Modern Web Application with React, TypeScript, and Vite

This project is a cutting-edge web application built with a powerful technology stack:

* React: For building user interfaces with a declarative and component-based approach.
* TypeScript: For enhanced developer experience with type safety and improved code maintainability.
* Vite: A modern build tool that significantly speeds up development workflows.
* **Additional Technologies:**
  * Mapbox: Provides interactive maps for location-based functionalities.
  * Apache ECharts: Enables creation of powerful and customizable data visualizations.
  * NanoStore: Implements a lightweight state management solution for React applications.
  * Deck.gl: Leverages WebGL for creating interactive and performant data visualizations.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Node.js (version 14.x or higher):** Provides the JavaScript runtime environment.
* **Yarn (version 1.x or higher):** A fast and reliable package manager for dependency management.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use Git to clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and run `yarn` to install all required dependencies.

## Development Server

Start the development server using the following command:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

This will launch the application at <http://localhost:3000> by default.

Environment Setup
Important: Ensure you have the necessary environment variables set up before running the application. This includes API keys for services like Mapbox that require authentication.

Create a .env file in the project's root directory and define the required keys:

REACT_APP_MAPBOX_API_KEY=your_mapbox_api_key_here

# Add other environment variables as needed

Technology Stack
